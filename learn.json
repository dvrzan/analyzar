How can one judge the intelligence?\r\n\r\n\u2026as intelligent as humans. \r\n\r\nIf computers can, somehow, solve real-world problems, by improving on their own from the past experiences, they would be called \u201Cintelligent\u201D. Thus, the AI systems are more generic (rather than specific), have the ability to \u201Cthink\u201D and are more flexible.\r\n\r\n<strong>Intelligence is composed of:<\/strong>\r\n<li>\u0017\u2022 Reasoning<\/li>\r\n<li>\u2022 Learning<\/li>\r\n<li>\u2022 Problem Solving<\/li>\r\n<li>\u2022 Perception<\/li>\r\n<li>\u2022 Linguistic Intelligence<\/li>\r\n\r\n<strong>Need for AI:<\/strong>\r\n<li>1. To create expert systems which exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn, demonstrate, explain, and advice its users.<\/li>\r\n<li>2. Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as algorithms in a computer-friendly manner.<\/li>\r\n\r\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines - or human-machine hybrids - can be? A superintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind."
